CRITICAL REQUIREMENT MISSING: Node.js

I was unable to run the application because Node.js is not installed or not found in your system PATH.

To run this application, you MUST:

1. Download Node.js (LTS version) from: https://nodejs.org/
2. Install it on your computer.
3. RESTART your terminal or VS Code to load the new settings.
4. Run the following commands in this directory:

   npm install
   npm run dev

Once these steps are completed, the app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
